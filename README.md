# The Gaming Room

   
   The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. The game will be called “Draw It or Lose It” and is currently only available on android. This game aims to have multiple teams consisting of several people going four rounds at a minute each. When a picture is pulled from a library of images, one team guesses till time runs out. If not answered, each opposing team member gets to answer till 15 seconds run out.
   
  I did one thing well while designing this document which was understanding the client's needs. Once the requirements were understood, analyzing design constraints was a pretty smooth process.
   
  Having a design document handy is crucial as developers tend to overengineer usually. Hence, the design document helps developers to stick to the plan and complete everything in a disciplined manner.
  
  If I could choose one part of the design document, then it would be doing more operating system analysis. I needed more time to research each operating system to determine the best choice, particularly with this application. However, I preferred designing the game with Linux as it is flexible, cost-friendly, and has a lot of community support.
  
  I was given an initial document explaining what kind of things the client already had and what they wanted to happen in the future. Then, moving forward, I connected the pieces to do a more detailed analysis of the design constraints and which technologies to use based on their requests for their upcoming plans. It is essential to understand the client's needs upfront as it may lead to planning incorrectly and, even worse, developing a product different from what the client was looking for.
  
  The first step in designing the software was evaluating the application constraints several times. Doing so helped me determine which technologies could satisfy the application's needs. For example, waiting times are crucial for every game. Therefore, the technology stack should've been capable of doing efficient file compressing as the game may contain huge media files. Similarly, The Gaming Room is an online game, so the network quality is vital. Without low latency, the overall user experience would be impacted, which could easily lead the client to lose users and, eventually, money. 
  
  Finally, I will use similar strategies in the future, evaluating different operating systems, development tools, and other technologies based on the application needed to be developed. Also, I will invest in gaining knowledge about cloud computing platforms as they do not just offer tools or infrastructure but also recommendations specifically for your needs.
